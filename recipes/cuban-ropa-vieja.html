    <h2>Summary of the dish</h2>

        <p>This ropa vieja is great served on tortillas or over rice. Add sour cream, cheese, and fresh cilantro on the side.</p>
        
        
        <p>Ropa Vieja is a traditional Cuban dish with a rich history and vibrant flavors. Translating to "old clothes" in Spanish, 
            the dish gets its name from its shredded beef's resemblance to torn fabric. The main ingredient is slow-cooked and tender
            shredded beef, often braised with bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a blend of aromatic spices. This combination of ingredients
            creates a savory and slightly tangy flavor profile. Ropa Vieja is usually served with white rice and black beans, showcasing the 
            fusion of Spanish, African, and Caribbean influences that characterize Cuban cuisine. The dish's preparation involves cooking the 
            meat until it's so tender that it easily shreds, allowing the flavors to meld and create a truly satisfying meal. As a beloved and
            iconic dish, Ropa Vieja is not only a culinary delight but also a representation of Cuba's cultural heritage.</p>
